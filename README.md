Ollama Web UI Project

This project allows you to interact with the Ollama API via a web-based user interface (Web UI) running on your laptop. It provides a simple and intuitive way to interact with Ollama’s powerful language models without needing to directly interface with the API via command-line tools or scripts.
Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

    Ollama installed on your laptop: You can download and install Ollama from Ollama's website.
    Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager): You can download and install them from nodejs.org.
    A modern web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, etc.).

Features

    Web Interface: Interact with Ollama models through a simple web interface.
    Real-Time Conversations: Chat with language models, similar to chatting with a chatbot.
    Customizable Settings: Modify model parameters for personalized interactions (if supported by Ollama).
    Easy Setup: Set up and launch the web interface with just a few commands.
    Cross-Platform: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux as long as you have Node.js and Ollama installed.

Installation
1. Install Ollama

First, ensure that Ollama is installed and running on your laptop. You can get the latest version from the Ollama website.

To verify the installation, you can run:

ollama --version

This should return the version of Ollama you have installed.
2. Clone the Project

Clone this project to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ollama-webui.git
cd ollama-webui

3. Install Dependencies

Once you've cloned the repository, navigate to the project folder and install the necessary dependencies using npm:

npm install

4. Configure Ollama (Optional)

Some configurations or API keys may be needed to connect with Ollama. If required, follow the setup instructions in the Ollama documentation.

Ensure that your Ollama API service is up and running.
5. Run the Web UI

Now that the project is set up, you can start the web interface with the following command:

npm start

This will start a local server (usually at http://localhost:3000), and you can interact with the web UI in your browser.
Using the Web UI

    Input Field: Type in your queries or prompts in the input box, and press "Enter" to send them to the Ollama model.
    Response Area: The model’s response will appear below the input field, providing the language model’s output based on your input.
    Settings: Modify settings like the model, temperature, or other parameters (if supported by Ollama) to control the output style and behavior.

Customization

You can customize the appearance and behavior of the Web UI by editing the following files:

    /public/index.html: Customize the HTML structure.
    /src/styles.css: Modify the CSS for styling the web page.
    /src/app.js: Adjust the JavaScript code for handling interactions with the Ollama API.

If you want to use a different language model or change settings for the Ollama API, update the necessary configuration in the backend code (if applicable).
Troubleshooting

    Unable to Connect to Ollama: Ensure that Ollama is running properly and check the terminal for any errors. You may need to check if the API key or network settings are correctly configured.

    Web UI Not Loading: If the web UI isn't loading, ensure that your Node.js server is running. You can check for errors by looking at the terminal output where you ran npm start.

    Cross-Origin Issues: If you encounter CORS issues when making API requests to Ollama, ensure the server is set up to handle CORS requests, or use a proxy server.
